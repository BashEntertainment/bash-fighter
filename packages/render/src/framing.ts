// PRESENTATION FIX (dead-space-below-floor pass 2026-09-12, see wiki
// "Camera Dead Space Below Floor Fix 2026-09-12"): the fall:jump split
// below used to be 90:200, i.e. every framed box reserved a fall-headroom
// band that was ~30% of the *raw* headroom span (before per-stage
// platform-height padding stretches maxY further) purely below the
// ground -- on stages/moments where nothing is actually down there
// (fighters that fall are gone in well under a second), this read on
// screen as a dead, wasted band under the floor (measured: ~18-25% of
// viewport height across battle-royale-20, the-foundry and a shrunk
// late-match arena). The sum (290 world units) is left exactly the same
// -- so overall zoom/scale and everything the aspect-padding step in
// computeFramingFloor does with it is unaffected -- only how that fixed
// budget is split between "show a hard landing below the ground" and
// "show a rising jump above it" changes. 40 world units is still enough
// to see a fighter's fall/spike below the platform before they leave the
// blast rect (falls are the fast, brief case; the full blast-zone clamp
// two steps below still shows however much further a knocked-out
// fighter actually falls, this is only the *minimum* reserved band).

// Population-aware floor shrink (empty-sky pass 2026-09-12, see wiki
// "Camera Population Floor 2026-09-12"). computeFramingFloor() above
// intentionally never lets the camera zoom tighter than the arena's
// own fought-over footprint -- right for a full 20-fighter lobby, where
// fighters are naturally spread near that footprint anyway. But late in
// a match, once most fighters are eliminated, the survivors are often a
// small cluster far smaller than the *original* arena footprint (the
// live blast rect shrinks with the collapsing ring, but not down to
// "wherever the few survivors happen to be" -- it's population/ground
// derived, not position derived). The result, confirmed by watching
// live matches: a 2-3 fighter endgame framed inside a floor sized for a
// much bigger fight, with most of the screen showing empty sky/void.
//
// This scales the already-computed floor box down around its own
// center as living-fighter count drops, so the *minimum* the camera
// will ever show shrinks with the fight. It does not, by itself, change
// what fraction of the screen fighters occupy -- computeCamera's own
// max(fighterSpan, floorSpan) logic still grows the frame back out
// whenever the actual fighters are more spread out than this scaled
// floor, so a spread-out 2-fighter chase across a wide stage is framed
// on the fighters, not clipped to a small box. This only removes
// *unused* floor headroom, never fighter positions -- every living
// fighter's position is always still included in computeCamera's own
// fSpan and therefore always on screen; nothing here can crop a
// fighter, an incoming attacker, or a hazard off-screen.
//
// Constants: no shrink at 6+ living fighters (this is where "spread
// close to the full arena" starts being the common case in practice --
// confirmed live, see wiki), tapering linearly down to 45% of the full
// floor span at 2 fighters (a 55% reduction in each axis, ~80% less
// area) and held there for the final 1-2. 45% (not lower) is a
// deliberate floor-on-the-floor: shrinking further starts to risk the
// same "camera slams in and jitters as two fighters trade a few units
// of ground" feel the existing paddingWorld/maxScale settings were
// tuned to avoid, for a readability gain past this point that live
// testing didn't show clearly justified.
