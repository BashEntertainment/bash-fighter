// Raw keyboard state tracker: listens once at module scope per instance and
// exposes a plain "is this code held" query. No sim/browser coupling beyond
// KeyboardEvent.code, and it never touches sim modules.
//
// Focus correctness (issue #35): the game's real interactive controls (mute,
// Controls, Moves, the touch action buttons, settings/move-reference panel
// buttons) are plain <button> elements so they stay in the tab order and
// keep default browser semantics -- that is deliberate, see touch-controls.ts.
// But because this class listens on `window`, a key pressed while one of
// those buttons has focus used to be read twice: once by the browser as a
// button activation (Enter/Space activate a focused button by spec) and
// once here as a raw game input (Space defaults to Jump). The fix is not to
// blur buttons on activation -- that would defeat tabbing and hide focus
// from keyboard users, actively harming accessibility for no gain. Instead,
// this only ignores events whose target is itself a focusable form control:
// the browser's own activation still fires (so Space/Enter on a focused
// button still presses it, no regression there), but the same keystroke no
// longer also reaches the game as a movement/action input. A key with focus
// resting on the game surface (the body, canvas, or any non-control element)
// is completely unaffected and drives the game exactly as before.
// Two different rules, because a button and a text field deserve different
// treatment (John, 2026-09-12): swallowing *every* key while a button holds
// focus would be a worse bug than the one being fixed -- a player who clicks
// the mute button with the mouse leaves it focused, and would then find the
// whole keyboard dead until they clicked the arena again. So for buttons and
// selects only the activation keys are withheld, since those are the only
// ones the browser also consumes. Text entry is different: while a name field
// or any editable element has focus, typing must never drive the fighter.
