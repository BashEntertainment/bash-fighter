 * Two channels over one WebSocket:
 *
 *  - Control messages are JSON text frames. They are infrequent (join, match
 *    start, elimination, match end), so legibility is worth more than bytes,
 *    and being able to read them in a browser's network tab is a real debugging
 *    advantage for contributors.
 *  - Inputs and snapshots are binary frames. These are the hot path: inputs go
 *    up at 60Hz and snapshots come down at SNAPSHOT_HZ, so every byte is
 *    multiplied by the tick rate and the player count.
 *
 * Both sides must agree on PROTOCOL_VERSION. A mismatch is refused at the
 * handshake with an explicit error rather than allowed to desync silently,
 * which is the single most confusing failure mode a deterministic netcode can
 * have: play looks fine for a few seconds and then two clients disagree about
 * reality with no error anywhere.
