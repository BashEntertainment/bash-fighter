// 2026-09-07 15:14 PDT): the win condition is a per-match *setting*, not a
// hardcoded rule, and the respawn model is per-mode rather than global.
//
// - 'battleRoyale' (DEFAULT): single elimination, no respawn. Last fighter
//   standing wins. The arena shrinks (see arena-shrink.ts) as the field
//   thins, forcing survivors together instead of leaving most of a
//   20-player match idle-dead for most of its length.
// - 'timedKO': highest KO count within a time limit. Fighters respawn
//   (briefly invulnerable) after being KO'd instead of being eliminated.
// - 'stocks': classic fixed-lives elimination, no arena shrink by default.
//   Kept as the direct generalization of the original 2-fighter stock mode.
