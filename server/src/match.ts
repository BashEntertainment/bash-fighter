// existed, because the sim is authoritative and does not need the client to
// keep up. What's new is that the seat stays reclaimable for a bounded grace
// window via an unguessable resume token, instead of being lost the moment
// the socket closes. A laptop sleeping, a phone switching networks, or a
// backgrounded tab is the common case for a browser game, not an edge case.
//
// Deliberately NOT implemented: bot-takeover of an abandoned seat after the
// grace window. The task brief only asks for "release the seat and
// invalidate the token" once the window expires or the fighter is
// eliminated -- it does not ask for the seat to keep playing under AI
// control afterwards, and a design that kept the token alive during a bot
// take-over would conflict with "the token no longer works" after the
// window. Simpler and matches the brief: once released, the seat just sits
// on neutral input like any other un-reclaimed disconnect, same as today.
