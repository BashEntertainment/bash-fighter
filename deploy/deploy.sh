#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Idempotent deploy script for bash-fighter on the Hetzner box.
#
# Usage (run as root or as a user with sudo, on the target box):
#   deploy/deploy.sh [ref]
#
#   ref   git ref to deploy (branch, tag, or commit). Defaults to
#         "main". Example: deploy/deploy.sh v0.3.0
#
# What it does, safely and re-runnably:
#   1. Fetches the repo into a fresh timestamped release directory
#      under /srv/bash-fighter/releases/<timestamp>-<short-sha>.
#   2. Installs production dependencies and builds the server + the
#      static client (npm workspaces; adjust the build commands below
#      once the real package scripts exist).
#   3. Atomically swaps /srv/bash-fighter/current to point at the new
#      release (symlink swap -- old release stays on disk untouched
#      until pruned, so a bad deploy can be rolled back by hand).
#   4. Publishes the built static client into /srv/bash-fighter/static
#      (what nginx serves) via an atomic symlink swap of its own.
#   5. Restarts the bash-fighter systemd service and waits for it to
#      report active.
#
# Configuration (PORT etc) is never invented here -- it is read from
# /srv/bash-fighter/shared/bash-fighter.env by the systemd unit
# (EnvironmentFile=-...). This script does not create or modify that
# file. See deploy/bash-fighter.env.example for the expected shape.
#
# Safe to re-run: every step is idempotent or additive. If a step
# fails, the script exits before swapping symlinks, so the previously
# deployed release keeps serving traffic -- the site is never left
# broken mid-deploy.
