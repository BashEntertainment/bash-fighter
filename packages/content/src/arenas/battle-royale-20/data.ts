  // 20 spawn points spread across the main platform, alternating sides so
  // adjacent fighter indices don't start adjacent on stage.
  //
  // BUG FIX (this task's stage audit): the previous formula used
  // `i % 10` as the slot, which repeats every 10 indices -- fighters 0
  // and 10, 1 and 11, ... 9 and 19 were all assigned the exact same (x, y)
  // spawn point, i.e. 20 "spawn points" that were really only 10 unique
  // positions, each stacked with two fighters on top of each other at
  // match start. `Math.floor(i / 2)` makes every one of the 20 positions
  // distinct while keeping the alternating-sides property.
  // PACING REWORK 2026-09-10 (see wiki dated "Match Pacing Rework"): production
  // journalctl evidence showed the 20-fighter opening was a single dense scrum
  // -- every fighter within immediate melee reach of several neighbours at
  // tick 0, so almost the whole field traded kills inside each bot's very
  // first AI decision, before any middle game could develop. Per-slot spacing
  // widened from 40 to 45 units (adjacent same-side gap 80->90, nearest
  // cross-side gap 40->45, and total span 400->439 each way, still inside
  // the 480 solid-ground edge) so the opening spreads fighters into separated
  // skirmishes instead of one shared brawl; still comfortably inside the
  // +-480 solid-ground span and the +-620 blast bounds.
  //
  // HUMAN-SURVIVAL FIX (2026-09-10, see wiki "Bot Difficulty Correction and
  // Human-Survival Fix 2026-09-10"): human seats are always addSeat'd
  // before bots fill the lobby (server/src/rooms.ts), so a human always
  // lands on the *lowest* fighter index. The old `slot = floor(i / 2)`
  // formula put the lowest indices at the smallest |x| -- literally the
  // exact centre of the whole spread, the single most crowded spot on
  // the stage at tick 0. A production sample showed the human 3rd-of-20
  // eliminated inside 30s despite active play, while the match otherwise
  // ran a healthy multi-phase match around them. Reversing the slot walk
  // (`9 - floor(i / 2)`) keeps every property of the spacing fix (still
  // distinct, still alternating sides, same span/gaps) but makes the
  // *lowest* indices land at the *outer* edge of the spread instead --
  // so a solo human's spawn is now the least crowded point on the stage,
  // not the most. Multiple humans in one lobby get the two next-most-open
  // points, and so on inward. Bot-only harnesses/fixtures are unaffected
  // in aggregate (it's the same 20 points, just relabelled), but any
  // fixture keyed to a specific fighter index's exact spawn position
  // needs regenerating -- see scripts/regen-golden.mjs.
  // OPENING-SECONDS KNOCKOUT FIX (2026-09-11, see wiki "Opening-Seconds
  // Knockouts on Battle Royale 20: 2026-09-11"): the outermost spawn slot
  // (34 + 9*45 = 439) sat only ~79 units from the live boundary
  // (computeGroundHalfExtents's 8% margin puts it at 480+38.4=518.4 while
  // the whole field is alive). Measured: Anchor's Forward Tilt (13 dmg,
  // base 13.0/1.0 growth) against a fresh 0%-damage fighter launches an
  // unstunted horizontal arc of ~108-136 units even scaled down by the
  // early-match knockback dampener -- comfortably past that 79-unit gap,
  // producing sub-15%-damage knockouts in the first 4 seconds on this,
  // the default and most-played stage. Widening the live boundary itself
  // (a per-stage standingMarginX override) was tried first and rejected:
  // it restored the full 140-unit authored blast clearance but slowed
  // this stage's own combat-driven match resolution enough to make
  // server/test/reconnect.test.ts's "match already ended" scenario time
  // out (reproduced 3/3 runs at quiet load; passed 2/2 without the
  // change) -- the same failure mode the 2026-09-10 margin work already
  // flagged for global margin increases. Compressing the spawn spacing
  // from 45 to 37 units per slot instead moves the outermost spawn to
  // 34 + 9*37 = 367, giving ~151 units of clearance (> the ~136-unit
  // worst measured arc, with headroom) without touching the boundary or
  // its shrink timeline at all, so match-resolution speed is unaffected.
  // Trade-off accepted and not fully resolved: this also tightens the
  // same-side adjacent-spawn gap from 45 to 37, partially walking back
  // the anti-scrum spacing widened for the "Bot Difficulty Correction"
  // pass on 2026-09-10 (see [[Character Roster]] history) for this stage
  // only. No dense-scrum regression was observed in the crowd20 checks
  // run for this fix, but it was not exhaustively re-verified.
