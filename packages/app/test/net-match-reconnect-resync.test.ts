// Regression for task #28231 (Client-Server Match Divergence follow-up): a
// resumed reconnect's startMatch() resets NetMatch's prediction clock
// (localTick) to 0 unconditionally, but the first snapshot after a resume
// carries the real, large mid-match server tick. Without resyncing forward,
// localTick stays permanently behind snap.tick and handleBinary's replay
// loop (`for t = snap.tick+1; t <= localTick`) never runs again for the
// rest of the match -- the local player's own prediction goes silently
// dead after any reconnect. Found and measured with
// scripts/reconnect-divergence-harness.mjs (replay window drifted to -52,
// -123, -192 ticks over three reconnect cycles without this guard).
//
// resyncLocalTickAfterSnapshot is exported as a pure, DOM-free function
// specifically so this can be tested without NetMatch's browser
// dependencies (Renderer/AudioManager/InputManager use parameter properties
// unsupported by Node's strip-only loader used by `npm test`).
