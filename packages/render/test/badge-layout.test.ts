// Regression test for issue #29: fighter name/slot badges overlapping
// in-world at 20-fighter density. layoutBadges() (packages/render/src/
// index.ts) already checks every candidate badge against every *other*
// fighter's body box before drawing it, degrading a too-long name to
// its numeric slot label, and dropping the badge entirely if even that
// collides -- but nothing locked that behaviour in. This exercises the
// extracted pure algorithm, computeBadgePlacements(), directly: no
// Pixi/DOM involved, same style as fighter-pose.test.ts and
// palette.test.ts.
//
// What's asserted, on real output geometry (never on the internal
// candidate ordering or the number of overlap checks performed):
//   1. No placed label's badge box ever intersects another fighter's
//      body box, across a variety of realistic 20-fighter layouts
//      (uniform ring, one tight cluster, fighters pinned to a screen
//      edge).
//   2. No two placed badge boxes intersect each other.
//   3. When a fighter's real name is too wide to fit next to a close
//      neighbour, the fallback to the bare slot-number label actually
//      engages (a scenario constructed to force it).
//   4. The local player's own badge is always placed (never dropped),
//      matching the exemption documented on layoutBadges.
